# Image-CNN-FL

This repository contains the code that introduces a new Federated Time Series Classification method that combines three different image representation techniques with CNN in a descentralized framework. In details three image representation techniques including NMotifs, FTSMotifs and Polar are used to convert raw data into image representation which are subsequently used as input for CNN. Afterward Federated Learning is used to enable colaborative training accross distributed clients to ensure data privacy.
